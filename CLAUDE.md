This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a D&D 5e tools website project called "Phoenix Tools" built with Vite, TypeScript, and React. The project is actively developed with a comprehensive React component structure for displaying D&D content.

## Development Commands

- **Start dev server**: `npm run dev` (runs Vite dev server)
- **Build project**: `npm run build` (runs TypeScript compilation then Vite build)
- **Preview build**: `npm run preview`

## Architecture

### Build System
- **Vite 7.1.3** with TypeScript and React support
- Single-page React application with `/phoenix-tools` base path
- Modern ES modules with TypeScript strict configuration

### Current Structure
The project has an established React component architecture:
- `src/main.tsx` - React application entry point
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component with React Router setup
- `src/components/` - React components organized by function:
  - `basic/` - Basic UI components (DetailRow, ProcessedDetailRow)
  - `content/` - Specialized D&D content display components:
    - `ActionDisplay.tsx` - D&D actions and bonus actions
    - `BackgroundDisplay.tsx` - Character backgrounds with proficiencies and traits
    - `BaseContentDisplay.tsx` - Common layout wrapper for all content pages
    - `ClassDisplay.tsx` - Character classes with progression and features
    - `ContentEntries.tsx` - Generic content entry renderer
    - `FeatDisplay.tsx` - Feats with prerequisites and abilities
    - `ItemDisplay.tsx` - Magic items and equipment with properties
    - `MonsterDisplay.tsx` - Creature stat blocks and abilities
    - `RaceDisplay.tsx` - Character races with traits and subraces
    - `SpellDisplay.tsx` - Spells with comprehensive casting information
    - `shared/` - 9 reusable components for common D&D data (AbilityScores, SpeedDisplay, etc.)
  - Search and filtering components (SearchInput, SearchResults, CategoryFilter)
  - `ContentPage.tsx` - Individual content page wrapper with URL routing
  - `SearchPage.tsx` - Main search interface
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions:
  - `routing.ts` - URL slug generation and content path utilities
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for data loading and search
- `src/services/` - Data loading and content management services
- `src/index.css` - Global styles
- `index.html` - Single HTML entry point with React root

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1, TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 7.8.2 for client-side navigation
- **Build**: Vite 7.1.3 with React plugin
- **Search**: ElasticLunr 0.9.5 and Lunr 2.3.9 for client-side search
- **Storage**: LocalForage 1.10.0 for offline data persistence  
- **Legacy**: jQuery 3.7.1 maintained for compatibility
- **Linting**: ESLint 9.34.0 with TypeScript and React plugins

### Key Features
- **Content Linking System**: SEO-friendly URLs with pattern `/{category}/{source}/{slug}`
- **Comprehensive D&D Content Display**: Specialized components for all major D&D content types
- **Shared Component Architecture**: 9 reusable components for common D&D data patterns
- **Fallback Data Loading**: Robust content loading with multiple source fallback strategies
- **Cross-Content Linking**: Internal links between related D&D content (spells â†” classes, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface with consistent styling patterns

### Development Notes
- Uses ES2022 target with strict TypeScript configuration
- React JSX configured for modern React transform (`react-jsx`)
- Strict linting with unused locals/parameters checking
- Jest configured for testing (minimal setup)
- Project deployed with `/phoenix-tools` base path
- Component composition pattern with shared utility components for D&D-specific data display
